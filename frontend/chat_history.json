Prerequisite: CMPUT 175.\n\n* **CMPUT 301 - Introduction to Software Engineering:** Covers object-oriented design and analysis, with interactive applications as the primary example. Topics include software process, revision control, UML, requirements, software architecture, design patterns, frameworks, design guidelines, unit testing, refactoring, and software tools. Prerequisite: CMPUT 201 or 275.\n\n* **CMPUT 401 - Software Process and Product Management:** Reviews all phases of software development from a process perspective. Introduces best practices in software project and product development and management.  Considers architectural and technological impacts on management.  Includes group projects requiring specification and initial design or redesign of a software system. Prerequisite: CMPUT 301.\n\n* **CMPUT 402 - Software Quality:** Covers software quality issues and various types of software testing (unit to integration testing). Introduces processes to ensure quality (reviews and continuous integration) and describes state-of-the-art software quality tools. Prerequisite: CMPUT 301.\n\n* **CMPUT 502 - Software Quality:**  (Graduate level)  Similar to CMPUT 402, but at a more advanced level.  Credit cannot be obtained for both CMPUT 402 and 502.\n\n\nThese courses progress in difficulty, building upon foundational programming concepts to more advanced software engineering principles and practices, including project and product management, and quality assurance.\n"
