            "bot_response": "### Courses to Improve GPA after Failing MATH 154\n Since you failed MATH 154 (Calculus for Business and Economics I),  several courses could help raise your GPA, depending on your academic goals and interests.  However, to recommend the *best* courses, I need more information.  Specifically: \n* **What is your major?**  This will help determine which courses are relevant to your degree requirements.\n* **What are your strengths and weaknesses in mathematics?** Did you struggle with specific concepts in MATH 154?  Knowing this will help me suggest courses that build upon your strengths or address your weaknesses.\n* **What is your current GPA?**  This will help me assess how much your GPA needs to improve.\n However, here are some general options, categorized for clarity: \n#### Remedial/Foundation Courses:\n* **MATH 114 (Elementary Calculus I):** This is a less rigorous introduction to calculus than MATH 154.  It might be a good option if you need to rebuild your foundational calculus skills.  *However, check if you can take this for credit given that you've already attempted MATH 154.*\n#### Alternative Calculus Courses:\n* **MATH 134 (Calculus for the Life Sciences I):** If you're in a life sciences-related field, this may be a more applicable alternative.\n* **MATH 144 (Calculus for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences I):** If you're in a physical science or mathematics-related field, this would be a better fit.\n#### Higher-Level Courses (If you're comfortable with the prerequisites):\n Taking a higher-level course and doing well could significantly boost your GPA.  However, this is only advisable if you're confident you can handle the material. Examples include: \n* **MATH 209 (Calculus for Engineering III):** Requires MATH 101 as a prerequisite.\n* **MATH 214 (Calculus III):** Requires one of MATH 101, 115, 118, 136, 146, or 156.\n**Important Note:** Before enrolling in any course, please check the University's course catalog and academic advisor to ensure the course meets your degree requirements and you are eligible to take it.  They can also provide personalized advice on how to improve your GPA."
