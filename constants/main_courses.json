Topics include: optimization approaches (constrained optimization, hessians, matrix solutions), deep learning and neural networks, generative models, more advanced methods for assessing generalization (cross-validation, bootstrapping), introduction to non-iid data and missing data. Credit cannot be obtained for both CMPUT 467 and 567 or CMPUT 367 and 567."
